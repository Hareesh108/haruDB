HaruDB supports ACID transactions with WAL integration.

## Basics

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
COMMIT;
ROLLBACK;
```

## Savepoints

```sql
SAVEPOINT sp1;
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT sp1;
```

## Isolation Levels

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
BEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
BEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
```

## Example

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO orders VALUES (1, 1, 'Laptop', '1', '999.99');
UPDATE inventory SET stock = '9' ROW 0;
COMMIT;
```
