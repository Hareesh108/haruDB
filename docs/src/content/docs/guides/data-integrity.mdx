description: WAL-based durability, crash recovery, and atomic writes.

- Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) ensures changes are logged before being applied.
- Crash recovery with automatic WAL replay on startup.
- Atomic writes â€” changes are fully applied or not at all.
- Data consistency is guaranteed by WAL.
